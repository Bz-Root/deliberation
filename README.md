## General Introduction

As part of my second year in the Computer Engineering cycle at Moulay Ismail University, I was presented with a 4-month project that allowed me to apply my theoretical knowledge through a project specification defining the design and development of an application intended for the deliberation of Bachelor students. This project had been initiated during the 2019-2020 academic year by my colleagues, and I was tasked with making modifications and potential enhancements.

Initially, I wasn't quite clear about administrative management, so I turned to online resources to understand that it involves managing students, their grades, teachers, and attendance.

The project began in early March 2020. My colleagues provided me with the necessary code to deploy the project on my computer, along with the report that contained the project specification upon which the initial development was based. My initial task was to verify and test the application developed by my colleague to ensure that its functionalities executed correctly and to identify any necessary modifications. After testing the program and understanding its construction and operation, I sought to understand the tasks assigned to me. I asked my supervisors for clarification, and they provided me with an oral description of my project's objectives, as well as the updated electronic version of the project specification. I identified issues with the project's implementation due to incomplete functionalities, and to address this, I decided to embark on a new project with a fresh design. I conceptualized an initial use case diagram to better understand the project specification and to ensure comprehensive feature completion.

After creating my first class diagram, I executed a small test project to become familiar with the required libraries. I began coding on April 7th. I considered the software engineering concept of extensibility to incorporate additional features into the application. I also adhered to a data dictionary to make my code readable and understandable to other programmers. The application could be deployed on the local server of the Bachelor's department for testing using real data.

This report provides a comprehensive overview of the development of this project, detailing how I extended the initial project's design and analysis. It outlines the selection of elements to add, modify, maintain, or discard, all based on the updated project specification. I also attempted to establish a timeline for the application's realization to ensure alignment with set objectives.

## General Project Context
### Overview

The Bachelor's program in Meknes is gaining increasing popularity among new high school graduates nationwide. The growing demand for this program places a heavier workload on the administration. The computerization of administrative management is a good solution to streamline tasks such as calculating the grades of students enrolled in various programs and semesters, as well as tracking teacher compensation.

A robust system, subject to control, and a platform enabling each student to access their profile, view their grades, and print academic transcripts for administrative and pedagogic enrollment.

### Objectives

This developed application aims not only to provide the individuals responsible for the administration of the Bachelor's program with adequate tools to effectively carry out daily tasks, but also to provide students and teachers with other tools for faster and more effective communication with the administration. The application also facilitates grade management through an evaluation system that handles grade retrieval, deliberation, and automatic enrollment based on conditions defined by the administrator. The application also offers students a portal for easy access to grade information and their academic journey.

## Preliminary Study

### Existing System Analysis

1. **Administrator Interface**: Allows management of the institution and all aspects of the academic structure.
2. **Administrator Interface**: Manages student records and administrative and pedagogic enrollment.
3. **Administrator Interface**: Modifies grades and deliberates student grades using an intelligent pedagogic registration system that automatically records the next step if the student passes. Also includes the ability to print a summary report for each deliberation.
4. **Administrator Interface**: Manages the administrator's profile.
5. **Administrator Interface**: View the history of each action performed by the administrator.
6. **Administrator Interface**: Ability to view and modify grades.
7. **Teacher Interface**: Inputs grades for their subjects and downloads the list of students they teach for each academic year based on their subject.
8. **Teacher Interface**: Manages user account.
9. **Module Responsible Interface**: Specialized teacher interface responsible for modifying coefficients of the elements of each module they oversee.
10. **Module Responsible Interface**: Offers deliberation capabilities for the modules they oversee and the ability to print a PDF report summarizing all student grades.
11. **Program Responsible Interface**: Specialized teacher interface responsible for modifying module coefficients and corresponding validation and elimination grades.
12. **Program Responsible Interface**: Provides a deliberation system for the program they oversee, with the ability to print PV reports summarizing the deliberation.
13. **Student Interface**: Allows students to view their grades after each deliberation.
14. **Student Interface**: Ability to download a transcript for each semester.
15. **Student Interface**: Ability to download a certificate of enrollment.
16. Each actor can view account management and change their password.


## Acknowledgments

I would like to express my gratitude to my professors and mentors who provided guidance and assistance throughout the development of this project. Their insights and feedback were invaluable in shaping the direction of the application.

I would also like to thank my fellow students for their collaboration and support. We worked together to overcome challenges and exchange ideas, contributing to the success of the project.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, the development of this application allowed me to put into practice the theoretical concepts I've learned during my studies in Computer Engineering. It has been an enriching experience that deepened my understanding of software development, database management, and web technologies.

While the project has reached a stage of completion, there are always possibilities for improvement and expansion. As technology continues to evolve, the application can be further enhanced with new features and optimizations.

## Future Perspectives

Looking ahead, I envision the following future perspectives for this application:

- **User Experience Enhancement:** Continuously improving the user interface and experience to make the application more intuitive and user-friendly.

- **Advanced Analytics:** Introducing advanced data analysis and visualization features to provide insights into student performance and trends.

- **Integration with Mobile Platforms:** Developing mobile applications for students and administrators to access the system on the go.

- **Integration of AI:** Exploring the integration of Artificial Intelligence to automate certain processes and provide personalized recommendations.

- **Scalability:** Ensuring that the application's architecture is designed to accommodate a growing user base without compromising performance.

- **Security Enhancements:** Implementing robust security measures to protect sensitive student data and prevent unauthorized access.

## Final Thoughts

In conclusion, this project has been an incredible learning journey that allowed me to apply theoretical knowledge in a real-world context. The process of designing, developing, and testing the application has provided me with valuable insights into software engineering practices, teamwork, and problem-solving. I am proud of what has been achieved and excited about the potential for further improvement and innovation in the field of educational technology.
